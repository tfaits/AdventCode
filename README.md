# AdventCode
Place to drop scripts for the Advent of Code 2018

Names are pretty standardized: the puzzle inputs are presumed to be named "D#Q#.txt", where the first # is the day number, and the second # is either 1 or 2 (I'm not sure if the puzzle input for part 2 is ever actually different from part 1, but I'm leaving the possibility open).
Primary scripts for each part are named with lower-case, and will mostly be in python (eg, d1q1.py would be the script for part 1 of daty 1).

A few helper scripts may appear - the first example is 'processD4Q1.sh', which runs some bash stuff to reformat the puzzle inputs.
